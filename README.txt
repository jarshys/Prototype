When running the project, the console will show all the records in our database.

This is for testing purposes only, it wouldn't show the records in a production environment. The tester can then login to the application using the details provided, depending on the role they want to test. We have faculty, instructors and students.

After logging in the user will be shown a specific window for that role which shows a menu option for all the use cases we had planned for our system.

The file "test" should be in the root folder of the project. This file is our database and includes all the records needed for testing.
